This is a traditional command line interface blackjack card game. I implemented this project in my spare time in order to obtain hands-on experience with coding in Python. I included the Colorama library within this project to add some creative coloring to the dealt cards that are displayed accordingly inside the terminal window.
To run this program, execute the BlackJackTable.py file within the terminal. In order for Python's colorama library to work accordingly on my Windows 10 laptop, I needed to install Ansicon from https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/downloads
Without installing Ansicon, the colors would not appear and the corresponding codes that Colorama uses for colors would be printed instead.
